                <p>
I am a ten-year veteran of the IT industry working as an implementation engineer who is looking to make a shift into the development side. I have experience with Linux server and MySQL in my current position. I also have experience with project management, extensive client interaction daily, as well as being in a mentoring position for up-and-coming IT professionals.
                    <br />
                    <br />
From a development position I do have small amounts of professional experience doing web development contacting after college. I have recently been certified in full stack development. The languages, frameworks, and other tools that I have experience with are: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and React  to name a few.
